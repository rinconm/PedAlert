# ZotWalk
An automatic pedestrian detection and alert system designed for ENGI Tank, a project showcase hosted by the Engineering Student Council (ESC) at the University of California, Irvine.

## Description
The Zotwalk project is a night-time system designed to reduce pedestrian casualties due to inattentive drivers. The system uses doppler radar sensors to detect oncoming vehicles and pedestrians at a crosswalk. When pedestrians are crossing, radar sensors will measure the velocity of oncoming cars, and will execute an alert protocol if vehicles do not slow down as they approach the crosswalk. The alert protocol consists of flashing LEDs, a siren sound, and projection of a warning signal on the road to alert both the driver and pedestrian.

One "blackbox" consists of the microcontroller, 2 mmW radar sensors, several LEDs, a speaker, and a projector. The system consists of pairs of blackboxes (1 pair minimum) communicating to each other for accuracy.
