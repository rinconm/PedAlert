# ZotWalk
An automatic pedestrian detection and alert system designed for ENGI Tank, a project competition hosted by the Engineering Student Council (ESC) at the University of California, Irvine.

## Description
The Zotwalk project is a night-time system designed to reduce pedestrian casualties due to inattentive drivers. The system uses doppler radar sensors to detect oncoming vehicles and pedestrians at a crosswalk. When pedestrians are crossing, radar sensors will measure the velocity of oncoming cars, and will execute an alert protocol if vehicles do not slow down as they approach the crosswalk. The alert protocol consists of flashing the LED lamp, playing a siren sound on a speaker, and projecting Peter the Anteater with a red line on the street for both visual and audible cues to alert both the driver and pedestrian crossing the street.

One "blackbox" consists of the pcb that houses the microcontroller, a 2.4 Ghz transceiver, a light sensor, 2 doppler radar sensors, an LED lamp, a speaker, and a projector. The system consists of a pair of blackboxes communicating to each other for increased accuracy and improved alert visibility.
