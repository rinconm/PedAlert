# PedAlert
An automatic pedestrian detection and alert system designed for the ENGI Tank showcase hosted by the Engineering Student Council (ESC) at the University of California, Irvine.

## Description
The PedAlert project is a night-time system that alerts crossing pedestrians of inattentive oncoming drivers. The system uses doppler radar sensors to detect oncoming vehicles and pedestrians at a crosswalk. When pedestrians are crossing, a radar sensor will measure velocity of oncoming cars, and will execute an alert protocol if vehicles do not slow down. The alert protocol consists of flashing LED, siren sound, and projection of a warning signal on the road to alert the driver and pedestrian.
One system consists of two or more blackboxes (two blackboxes required for each walkpath) communicating to each other.
